<h2>Biography</h2>

I am an <a href="https://fcai.fi">FCAI</a> postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, working with <a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/aklami/">Arto Klami</a> and <a href="https://lacerbi.github.io">Luigi Acerbi</a>. I did my PhD at Aalto University under the supervision of <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski">Samuel Kaski</a>. I have two Master's degrees, one in Mathematics and one in Economics, from the University of Helsinki.

<!---
Prior to that, I worked as an intern at various national research institutes (VATT, Statistics Finland, University of Helsinki) and as a data scientist at few start-ups. I do consulting for <a href="https://soilwatch.eu">SoilWatch</a> on calibration and uncertainty quantification of soil carbon models.

<h2>Research</h2>
My research focuses on probabilistic deep learning, particularly on learning from human data. At its core, my work combines random utility theory with modern probabilistic models, such as normalizing flows and score-based models, to create flexible representations of beliefs held by various oracles, including humans and LLMs. As an example, check this <a href="[https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski](https://nips.cc/media/neurips-2024/Slides/93389.pdf)">poster</a>. Key areas of interest include flow and diffusion models, elicitation (knowledge/prior elicitation, preference learning), and Bayesian optimization.

<h2>Applications</h2>

The ML methods relevant to my research can be harnessed to incorporate human perspectives into machine learning systems, such as addressing AI alignment issues and designing recommender systems. In addition, Bayesian optimization can be used to solve a broad spectrum of optimization tasks involving diverse and noisy sources of data.

<h2>Community involvement</h2>
I have acted as a reviewer for AISTATS (awarded top-10% reviewer), Bayesian Analysis, UAI, TMLR, and IEEE TPAMI.
