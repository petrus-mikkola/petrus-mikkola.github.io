<h2>Theses</h2>
My <a href="https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/server/api/core/bitstreams/4544ab61-fd4a-4d21-bd4f-92d1e346a886/content">doctoral thesis</a>, winner of the Aalto <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/school-of-science-awards-outstanding-doctoral-and-masters-theses">thesis award</a>, studies the use of humans as information sources, particularly in Bayesian optimization settings.

In my mathematics <a href="https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/330731">M.Sc. thesis</a>, I studied discrete complex power functions on isoradial graphs (a natural setting for discrete complex analysis) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/mathphys/Izyurov">Konstantin Izyurov</a>. In my economics [M.Soc.Sci thesis](../files/thesis_econ.pdf), I studied what is the optimal replacement rate for technology-intensive capital. 
My [B.Soc.Sci thesis](../files/bachelor_thesis_econ.pdf) deals with the mathematical formalism of decision-making in economics (and surprisingly it's very relevant to my machine learning research on human modelling, see <a href="https://petrus-mikkola.github.io/publications/">Publications</a>).
